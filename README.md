Project Summary:

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)

It is designed to showcase my ability and knowledge of using testing frameworks, existing libraries, and be able to implement them into a function Web Service.

Instructions:

1. On the GitHub repository, click the green `<> Code` button, select the HTTPS tab, and copy the URL.

2. Within VSCode or a $bash Terminal, type the command "git clone <copied/url>".

3. This repository requires certain dependencies with the included minimum version;
   "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
   "express": "^4.21.1",
   "jest-sorted": "^1.0.15",
   "pg": "^8.7.3",
   "supertest": "^7.0.0"

For each dependency type the following into the terminal: npm i <dependency/name>

4. To connect to the database you will **need** to create two separate .env files with the required syntax;

- .env.test | PGDATABASE= nc_news_test
- .env.test | PGDATABASE= nc_news

5. The **minimum** required versions are;
